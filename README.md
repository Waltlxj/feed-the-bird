## Game Rules
This is basically a game that resembles basketball shooting, except that it is throwing food to a small adorable hungry chicken. The projectile is a parabola. The magnitude of the velocity is fixed in the program, and the player adjusts the angle of the shoot using mouse click. The program would show an animation of the food thrown to the chicken. The chicken will show happiness when the food falls onto it, but will show anger otherwise.  The upper left corner shows the chances left to make bad throws and show your score. After 10 fails, the game would be over and the program would show the final score, which is the number of times the player successful feed the chicken.
